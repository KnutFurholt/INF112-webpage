        <h1>Game Description</h1>
        <p>The game we're developing falls under the concept known as 'Tower Defense'.</p>
        <p>It is a strategy game where the objective is to defend the player's territory by placing defensive structures that eliminate waves of enemies before they can cross a given area.</p>
        <p>If the defense fails to hold back the attacks, the player loses, eventually.</p>
        <p>The win condition is if you manage to defend against all the attacks.</p>
        <p>The game is primarily played using a computer mouse to place these defensive structures in strategic locations.</p>
